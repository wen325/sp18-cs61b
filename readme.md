After finishing cs61a, I start cs61b. Here is my notes for cs61b.

It takes me about two month(11/29-01/30) to finish this great course.

You can learn basic java, data structure and algorithm in this cource.

The prof josh hug is so kind that posts register code for gradescope(autograde).

Some hard problems:

1. Project 2 part 1 is very tricky and time consuming. If you cannot come up with an idea, I suggest you search for idea from the Internet.
2. Project 3 part 2. If you are not familiar with graph, BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm.
3. Makeup hw6 Boggle. The one is even harder than Word Serach problem in leetcode, the latter one is already a hard problem.
